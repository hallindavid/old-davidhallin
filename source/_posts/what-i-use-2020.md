This page is inspired by some other developer's "my setup" pages.

## IDEs

So I largely do 2 types of programming, PHP and Go. 

For most of my PHP work I use <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/">PhpStorm</a> and for most of my Go work I use <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/go/">GoLand</a>.

These are both made by JetBrains so they have an annual subscription associated with them, but the code completion and package imports make these things pretty awesome.

I use a pretty generic dark theme, and the FiraCode font for both of them.  The only real customization I've done is moving the project panel to the right-hand side which I saw in <a href="https://calebporzio.com/my-vs-code-setup-2">Caleb Porzio's VS Code Setup</a>, and I think it fit's my needs better.

I also keep a few other IDEs/editors on my system.

<a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/3">Sublime Text 3</a> - The IDE I was using before - I still find the multiple selection tools really comfortable in Sublime Text, so when I'm trying to do mass edits, to a CSV or something like that, I'll usually pop open Sublime.

<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a> - I usually use this for my static website projects (using vue or alpine and html)

## Computers

I have 2 computers that I use for my dev work.

My primary computer is a 2017 15" MacBook Pro

My secondary computer is an <a href="https://store.hp.com/CanadaStore/Merch/Offer.aspx?p=hp-spectre-x360-convertible-laptop&lang=EN-CA">HP Spectre x360</a> ( 15.6" 4K/i7/16GB/512SSD )

The reason I need to use two separate machines is because I prefer Mac, and it works for most of my development work, but occasionally I need to build and compile for windows, so I have my HP for that. 

The HP also has a great flip over touch screen with a stylus, so it works pretty great for taking notes or doing conferences.
